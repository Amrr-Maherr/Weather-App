# 🌦️ Weather-App - Project Explanation and Technologies Used 🌦️

---

## 📝 Project Description 📝

Weather-App is a simple web application that displays the current weather conditions for a given location. The application utilizes the WeatherAPI API ☁️ to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The primary goal is to deliver weather information in an accessible and straightforward manner to users. The application's design was created using Figma 🎨 to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features ✨

*   📍 Display current weather conditions for a specified location.
*   🌡️ Show detailed weather information, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, visibility, and UV index.
*   🗺️ Render an interactive map for the chosen location using Leaflet.
*   🎨 Provide an attractive and intuitive user interface employing Framer Motion for smooth animations.
*   🔔 Display notifications using react-hot-toast to inform users of errors or important updates.
*   ⏳ Implement a loading screen using react-spinners while fetching data from the API.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 🛠️

*   ⚛️ **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React forms the foundation of the application, providing a robust and flexible structure for creating the UI.
*   📡 **Axios:** A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. Axios is used to fetch data from the WeatherAPI API.
*   💨 **Framer Motion:** A React library for animations. Framer Motion is used to add smooth and engaging animations to the user interface.
*   💬 **react-hot-toast:** A React library for displaying notifications. react-hot-toast is used to display error messages and warnings to the user.
*   🌍 **Leaflet:** A JavaScript library for interactive maps. Leaflet is used to display an interactive map of the selected location.
*   📍 **react-leaflet:** Leaflet integration with React. Provides a simple way to use Leaflet within React components.
*   🔄 **react-spinners:** A collection of loading spinners for React. react-spinners is used to display a loading screen while fetching data from the API.
*   ☁️ **WeatherAPI:** An API for obtaining weather data ([https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/)).  This is the API used to fetch weather data for the application.
*   🎨 **Figma:** A design tool used to create the user interface for the application. You can view the design on Figma here: [Weather website & Dark Weather (Community)](https://www.figma.com/design/g2CqEhNQeoG9Gr8tAqa5xt/Weather-website-%26-Dark-Weather-(Community)?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=J2hs1VCEGtKySkgJ-0)
